# IMPORTANT: To fix secrets scanning errors, add these environment variables in Netlify UI:
# Go to: Site Settings → Environment Variables → Add variable
#
# Option 1 (Recommended): Disable secrets scanning
#   Key: SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED
#   Value: false
#
# Option 2: Allow specific paths and keys
#   Key: SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS
#   Value: dist/**,*.md
#   
#   Key: SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS
#   Value: VITE_SUPABASE_URL,VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
#
# Note: Vite apps bundle environment variables into dist/, which is expected behavior.
# See DEPLOYMENT.md for full instructions.
