# Secrets scanning configuration
# Vite apps bundle environment variables into the build output, which is expected behavior.
# Add this environment variable in Netlify UI (Site settings → Environment variables):
# SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED = false
#
# Or to allow specific keys and paths:
# SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS = "dist/**,*.md"
# SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS = "VITE_SUPABASE_URL,VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
